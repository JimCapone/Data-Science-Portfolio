# Data Science Project Portfolio

My name is James Capone and I am an aspiring data scientist.

I'm a recent Master's graduate in Data Science and looking to showcase the skills and knowledge I've acquired so far. 

The current projects are focused on python along with Scikit-Learn to build machine learning models to produce a desired prediction outcome. More projects will be added as I continue my journey through Data Science.

If you'd like to reach out with any inquiries or suggestions, please don't hesitate to do so.
